title: Eric Lam - Sheet Music
---
<p>Here is a bunch of the sheet music that I have transcribed over the years. Most of it has been arranged from MIDI's I have found throughout the internet, but a select few have been done mostly or completely by ear. I hope you enjoy!</p>
<p>I have arranged pretty much all of this sheet music with <a href="https://musescore.org">MuseScore</a>. Especially with some of the songs that I have done by ear, it has helped to use the free, open-source, audio editing program <a href="https://audacity.sourceforge.net/">Audacity</a></p>
<p>Also make sure to check out some of the sheet music from some of my favoirte places such as <a href="https://www.ninsheetm.us/">NinSheetMusic</a>, <a href="https://herbalcell.com/free-sheet-music">herballcell</a>, <a href="https://www.zeldacapital.com/sheet.php">Zelda Capital</a>, and <a href="https://rampancy.net/sheetmusic">Rampancy</a>.</p>
