	<h1>About</h1>
	<hr>
	<h2>Co-Captain of <a target="_blank" href="http://ballroom.union.rpi.edu">RPI Ballroom Team</a></h2>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was voted as one of two Captains on RPI's Ballroom Dance Team, taking an active part in team organization as well as a role in club events and planning. Additionally, I began taking care of the website, keeping it up clean and up-to-date.</p>
	<br />
	<h2>Student at <a target="_blank" href="http://rpi.edu">Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute</a></h2>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting in the Fall of 2013 I began majoring in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, with a Minor in Cognitive Science. I began learning new programming languages in addition to computer science theory in the areas of CS. With engineering, I began to learn CAD and engineering analysis, and soon began to take more hands-on classes involving electrical circuits as well as working with microprocessors, combining programming knowledge with wiring and circuitry.</p>

	<h2>Software Development Intern at <a target="_blank" href="http://octopart.com">Octopart</a></h2>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Octopart, a tech start-up in the Flatiron District of Manhattan, is a electronics part search engine, striving to make part acquisition easier. During the summer of 2013, I worked in developing numerous parsing rules to process large amounts of part numbers automatically. In addition, I wrote web crawlers to get additional information about parts from manufacturer websites.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Summer of 2014, I took part in nearly overhauling the extensive webcrawling framework, making it easier to use as well as easier to distribute across multiple machines. Lastly, I took part in leading a few students to use our part-parsing framework.</p>

	<h2>President of Software Engineering - <a target="_blank" href="http://stuypulse.com">StuyPulse</a></h2>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 2010, I took part in FRC Robotics Team 694, StuyPulse. From 2011 to 2012 I was the team's webmaster, and the following year I was the president of the Software Engineering Department. The team won the Website Award and the prestigious Chairman's Award at the 2012 Hartford Regional and in 2013 won at the New York City Regional, advancing to the World Championship for the fourth year in a row.</p>
	<br />
	<h2>Stuyvesant High School</h2>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I attended high school at one of the top science and math high schools of New York City, Stuyvesant High School. I took numerous advanced tech, science, and math courses (including Systems-Level programming, Graphics, Advanced CAD, Calculus), as well as a large amount of humanities courses to understand the world around us in a multitude of different aspects (US Government, Comparative Government, Economics). I graduated as part of the class of 2013.</p>
	<br />
	<h2>St. Joseph's Programming Competition</h2>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was part of a team of three which placed as the fourth team of dozens of high school teams from around the New York/Long Island area.</p>
