<p>This was a jam-packed summer.</p>

<p>I've already talked about my <a href="/2015/06/05/First_Week_at_Cisco.html">first week</a> and shown a little bit of <a href="/2015/06/18/I_Cook.html">all of the things that I have cooked</a> this summer. But the summer was much more packed than just that.</p>

<p>It was a crazy time at Cisco. I met many people, interns and full-timers alike. I worked on a team in <a data-toggle="tooltip" title="Unified Commerce Experience">UCE</a> in Cisco Commerce (under <a data-toggle="tooltip" title="Cisco Value Chain">CVC</a> under IT) with two other interns: Grant Doctor and Aparna Narayan. We worked on adding Spring-AOP-based performance metrics to the commerce system.</p>

<p>But the summer was packed full of activities. There was the CVC Picnic, we went to Santa Cruz, there was an IT Intern Showcase, and even a CVC Intern Showcase.</p>

<p>And I thought I took a lot of photos at those things.</p>

<p>I didn't spend many weekends sitting at home.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Once I visited some friends in Mountain View, also going to a local dance studio and having a blast.
  </li>
  <li>
    Another weekend, my intern buddy, Glen, and a few other people and I went hiking in Big Basin Redwoods State Park.
  </li>
  <li>
    July 4th weekend I went with a couple other interns to Yosemite, getting some of the best views of my life.
  </li>
  <li>
    Later I went with a fellow RPI student/Google intern to Mt. Tamalpais (Mt. Tam for short) State Park for some hiking.
  </li>
  <li>
    I trekked out to San Francisco another weekend, touring around, eating <i>way</i> too much food (stopping for Sushirrito, chashu baos, egg custard tarts, clam chowder, fried calimari, a Ghirardelli Sundae, a burrito...) as well as taking many, many photos.
  </li>
</ul>

    </a>
  </div>

<br />

<p>But there is more! I went with my Google friend to Monterey, where we visited the aquarium, ate, and drove along the shoreline. And there was Bricks by the Bay, a LEGO convention held in Santa Clara.</p>

</a>

<p>The summer proved to be quite a blast. I met wonderful people and learned a ton, both in a technical sense and in a professional sense.</p>

<p>Alas, though, the summer is over. I have moved back home, have finally finished going through (and editing) all my photos (of which I took nearly 6400, which I cut down to about 725 photos). Classes are just around the corner (I move back to RPI on Monday).</p>

<p>Next summer has to work hard to beat this.</p>
