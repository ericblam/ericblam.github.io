title: Last Day at Cisco, New Website
author: Eric Lam
---
It was a bittersweet day at Cisco. After saying too many good-byes yesterday to my managers, my coordinators, and my mentors, it was time to say good-bye to all the remaining interns today. Perhaps I will be back to Cisco in the future. Tomorrow never knows.

But I spent the day working. No, not on Cisco work, though. My laptop was returned yesterday. I was left with something I had been putting off for a while: making a new website. My old website was pretty... basic.

So I spent my time first migrating over to Jekyll. After that, my website looked... no different. But alas, this meant that if I had a template with navbars and such, I wouldn't have to copy code all of the time.

And so with some hard work, the website became responsive, and the result makes me happy. I can finally go on my website on a mobile device without shivering on the inside.
