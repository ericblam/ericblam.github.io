title: Updates!

After much too long, my website has been updated! Of course, for the most part, the important updates are not immediately noticeable. My <a href="/hobbies/sheetmusic">sheetmusic</a> and <a href="/blog">blog</a> pages have been revamped so now they automatically create the pages using JavaScript!

On another note, my <a href="/hobbies">hobbies</a> page has been updated. Aside from simply being more robust and detailed as to who I am as a person, it also now includes a <a href="/hobbies/gallery">gallery</a>, showing some of my favorite photographs (which I have taken). Make sure to check it out!
