title: Freshman Year at RPI Finished
author: Eric Lam

Two semesters, nine months, ten classes, 37 credits, and thousands of dollars later, my Freshman year at RPI has finised!

Whether it be going through classes like the mind-numbing Bio, the rigorous Data Structures, or the wonderful Minds and Machines and Introduction to Cognitive Science, I have learned quite a bit.

Also, to supplement my academic time, I have made a great number of wonderous friends, some from here and there and others from the wonderful Ballroom Club and Team. Increasing my dancing skills tenfold, I have been immersed in the of Ballroom Dance.

And so it is with a heavy heart that Freshman year is over. Not only will I have to spend several months away from the friends that I have grown to love, but some will be leaving the school for things beyond. I wish them the best!

Onwards to another great year at my favorite school!
