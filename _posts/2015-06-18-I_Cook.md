title: I Can Cook!
author: Eric Lam
---
<p>I surprised myself from the first day that I was in California. I cooked for myself, and it wasn't terrible.</p>
<p>I'm not saying that I've never cooked before. I cooked when my mother wasn't home every now and then, and I have cooked parts of meals here and there. And of course, I cooked my ramen all of the time (but I didn't just boil water and stick the stuff in. I had an egg and meat in there as well).</p>
<p>Of course, my first meal was ramen.</p>

</a>

<p>Though it was a little more legit than instant ramen.</p>
<p>I've cooked a lot, learning about exactly how I should cook what, and to an extent what to put with what. It's hard thinking of what vegetable goes with which meat (and what starch thing to put with it all).</p>

<p>Well, garlic is my friend. No doubt about that. I need to make sure to cook my pasta more (well, after that first time I was okay). Meat tastes the best cooked slowly on low heat (avoid turning it up unless you are in a hurry or trying to sear something). A typical mug can hold about 12oz of liquid.</p>

<p>I am enjoying cooking. I have a feeling I'm going to be feeding my girlfriend sometimes back at school... but I won't mind. Cooking is fun!</p>
