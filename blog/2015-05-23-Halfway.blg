<p>After finishing my last of five finals yesterday, I feel free.</p>
<p>First semester this year was Electric Circuits, CoCO (Computer Components and Operations), LITEC (Laboratory Introduction to Imbedded Control), Engineering Dynamics, and Introduction to Algorithms. A busy semester with quite the work load, but with some fun material (LITEC had some cool microcontroller stuff).</p>
<p>Then came along this semester, with Intro to Electronics, Operating Systems, Engineering Probability, Signals and Systems, Principles of Software, and even an ECSE Seminar class. It was a heck of a lot of fun (but so incredibly busy) and things are starting to get to the point where I am learning what I want to. Next semester will be great!</p>
<p>On top of all of that was Ballroom Dance. I continued with ballroom, dancing with Karen Baltazar. Though we didn't do too spectacularly in the Fall semester, we moved up to Silver for the Spring. With a bit of work, we we able to rock at the Bronze level and even do pretty well at the Silver level (great for a first-semester Silver couple).</p>
<p>Now I have a week to rest before I ship off to California to work for Cisco. I am going to have a blast!</p>
