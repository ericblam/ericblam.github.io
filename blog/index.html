<div class='blog'><h1 class='blog'>Summer Days
</h1><blog_date>August 17th, 2014
</blog_date><p>It has been a great summer working at <a href="https://octopart.com">Octopart</a> over the summer. Whether it be working to improve our data-collection framework or to kill numerous flies in the office, I definitely felt like part of the company. Part of the team. Part of a family.</p>
<p>And I definitely had a blast. The people at Octopart are definitely a large part of the experience. I loved everyone.</p>

<p>Of course, I'm going to miss Octopart, but not too much, because I'm going to aid in amassing a Data Army for Octopart (to collect data for us and to give us the most comprehensive coverage on part data around). We'll see how it goes, but I am hoping for the best.</p>
<p>Thanks again, Octopart, for having me around for another summer. I'm so glad that I could be part of the family. I'll keep in touch. See you soon, Octopart.</p>

</blog_date><p>After many months, I have finally returned to <a href="http://octopart.com">Octopart</a>! Seated in the Flatiron District of New York City, the company hosts an electronics part search engine.</p>
<p>I am glad to be back on board with the team for the summer.</p></div><br \><br \><div class='blog'><h1 class='blog'>Pre-Work Quiet

</h1><blog_date>May 17, 2014
</blog_date><p>Two semesters, nine months, ten classes, 37 credits, and thousands of dollars later, my Freshman year at RPI has finised!</p>
<p>Whether it be going through classes like the mind-numbing Bio, the rigorous Data Structures, or the wonderful Minds and Machines and Introduction to Cognitive Science, I have learned quite a bit.</p>
<p>Also, to supplement my academic time, I have made a great number of wonderous friends, some from here and there and others from the wonderful Ballroom Club and Team. Increasing my dancing skills tenfold, I have been immersed in the of Ballroom Dance.</p>
<p>And so it is with a heavy heart that Freshman year is over. Not only will I have to spend several months away from the friends that I have grown to love, but some will be leaving the school for things beyond. I wish them the best!</p>
<p>Onwards to another great year at my favorite school!</p></div><br \><br \><div class='blog'><h1 class='blog'>First Blog Entry!
