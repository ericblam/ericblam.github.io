<p>Two semesters, nine months, ten classes, 37 credits, and thousands of dollars later, my Freshman year at RPI has finised!</p>
<p>Whether it be going through classes like the mind-numbing Bio, the rigorous Data Structures, or the wonderful Minds and Machines and Introduction to Cognitive Science, I have learned quite a bit.</p>
<p>Also, to supplement my academic time, I have made a great number of wonderous friends, some from here and there and others from the wonderful Ballroom Club and Team. Increasing my dancing skills tenfold, I have been immersed in the of Ballroom Dance.</p>
<p>And so it is with a heavy heart that Freshman year is over. Not only will I have to spend several months away from the friends that I have grown to love, but some will be leaving the school for things beyond. I wish them the best!</p>
<p>Onwards to another great year at my favorite school!</p>
