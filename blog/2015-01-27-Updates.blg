<p>After much too long, my website has been updated! Of course, for the most part, the important updates are not immediately noticeable. My <a href="http://ericblam.com/hobbies/sheetmusic">sheetmusic</a> and <a href="http://ericblam.com/blog">blog</a> pages have been revamped so now they automatically create the pages using JavaScript!</p>
<p>On another note, my <a href="http://ericblam.com/hobbies">hobbies</a> page has been updated. Aside from simply being more robust and detailed as to who I am as a person, it also now includes a <a href="http://ericblam.com/hobbies/gallery">gallery</a>, showing some of my favorite photographs (which I have taken). Make sure to check it out!</p>
