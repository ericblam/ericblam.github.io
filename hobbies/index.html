title: Eric Lam's Hobbies
---
<!-- Summary -->
<p>Though I work hard on my school work all of the time, there must always be time for some relaxation, allowing my mind to rest and catch up. That is what my hobbies are for.</p>
<p>Though I am a technical person, studying computer science and computer & systems engineering, I am very much into different arts. These include ballroom dancing, photography, and music.</p>

<!-- Music -->
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-6">
    <p>With music, I started with the piano and eventually learned the recorder (which, contrary to popular belief, is a beautiful instrument), and the clarinet. I also have taught myself to play the guitar, the ocarina, and I have a multitude of smaller instruments, such as the harmonica.</p>
    <p>But my musical ability is not limited to playing back music. Oftentimes, I work hard to transcribe and arrange <a href="/sheetmusic">sheet music</a>, which I hope you will take a look at.</p>
    <p>If you have a request for me to make sheet music for a song, feel free to contact me! I will try my best to respond to your request!</p>

    <!-- Photography -->
    <p>My grandfather gave me my first camera, a Fujifilm Finepix A400, for Christmas in 2006. I've went through multiple cameras, borrowing my dad's HP PhotoSmart R717 once my old camera broke. And then I finally invested in my own camera, the Canon PowerShot SD1200 IS.</p>
    <p>At that point, I started getting a bit impatient with point-and-shoots. They were slow to react and didn't have the image quality I wanted. And once I started ballroom and taking photos, I knew I needed something better, and that is when I invested in a Canon EOS Rebel T3i. Nothing special, but it was the start of my more serious photography.</p>
    <p>You can view some of my photos in my <a href="/gallery">gallery</a>.</p>

<!-- Ballroom -->
<p>My ballroom dancing career started in eighth grade. From that point on, I knew that I wanted to do it the next chance I had, which was in my senior year of high school. At that point, I also made sure that I would become part of the Ballroom team in whatever university I went to after high school. So it was that I went to <a href="https://ballroom.union.rpi.edu">RPI</a> and joined the team there.</p>
